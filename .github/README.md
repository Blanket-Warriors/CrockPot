.github
========
This is a directory that holds Github related files. This includes templates, and a link to our contribution guide.

##### ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
Given to us in [this Github update](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates), this lets us create a template for Github Issues. We use Github issues because it keeps all of our concerns organized in the same place. This template just saves us some typing/copypasta.

##### PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
Given to us in the same update as [Issue templates](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates), we can also make a template for PR's! It does the same thing as `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`.
